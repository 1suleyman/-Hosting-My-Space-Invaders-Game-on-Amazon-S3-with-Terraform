# -Hosting-My-Space-Invaders-Game-on-Amazon-S3-with-Terraform
I decided to host my Space Invaders game on Amazon S3 using Terraform to make it publicly playable. This version of the project automates the creation of the S3 bucket, uploads game files, and configures static website hosting â€” all via Infrastructure as Code. By the end, anyone can play my game via a public URL! ðŸª£ðŸŽ®
