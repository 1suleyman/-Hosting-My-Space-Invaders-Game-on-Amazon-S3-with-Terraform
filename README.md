# ðŸŒŒ Hosting My Space Invaders Game on Amazon S3 with Terraform

I decided to host my **Space Invaders** game on **Amazon S3** using **Terraform**. This makes the game publicly playable without needing a server! ðŸª£ðŸŽ®

Terraform allows me to **declare the S3 bucket, public access, bucket policy, website hosting, and game file uploads in code** â€” reusable, version-controlled, and environment-friendly.

## ðŸ§© Terraform Workflow

This project is broken down into **five main steps**:

1. **Define variables**

   * Input variables include the AWS region, S3 bucket name, and local game folder path.
   * Values are set in `terraform.tfvars` for environment-specific overrides.
   * [See variables.tf](https://github.com/1suleyman/-Hosting-My-Space-Invaders-Game-on-Amazon-S3-with-Terraform/blob/main/space-invaders-terraform/variables.tf) | [See terraform.tfvars](https://github.com/1suleyman/-Hosting-My-Space-Invaders-Game-on-Amazon-S3-with-Terraform/blob/main/space-invaders-terraform/terraform.tfvars)

2. **Create the S3 bucket**

   * Terraform provisions a bucket using the name defined in the variables.
   * The bucket will later host the static website.
   * [See main.tf - bucket creation](https://github.com/1suleyman/-Hosting-My-Space-Invaders-Game-on-Amazon-S3-with-Terraform/blob/main/space-invaders-terraform/main.tf)

3. **Configure public access**

   * S3 buckets are private by default.
   * Terraform sets up public access so the game can be viewed by anyone online.
   * [See main.tf - public access configuration](https://github.com/1suleyman/-Hosting-My-Space-Invaders-Game-on-Amazon-S3-with-Terraform/blob/main/space-invaders-terraform/main.tf)

4. **Apply bucket policy**

   * Terraform applies a policy granting public read access to all objects in the bucket.
   * This ensures the game files can be loaded in a browser.
   * [See main.tf - bucket policy](https://github.com/1suleyman/-Hosting-My-Space-Invaders-Game-on-Amazon-S3-with-Terraform/blob/main/space-invaders-terraform/main.tf)

5. **Enable static website hosting and upload game files**

   * Terraform enables static website hosting with `index.html` as the entry point.
   * All files in the local `game/` folder are uploaded to S3.
   * After deployment, the website URL can be retrieved from outputs.
   * [See main.tf - website configuration and object uploads](https://github.com/1suleyman/-Hosting-My-Space-Invaders-Game-on-Amazon-S3-with-Terraform/blob/main/space-invaders-terraform/main.tf)

## âš¡ Deployment Steps

1. **Initialize Terraform**

```bash
terraform init
```

2. **Preview the changes**

```bash
terraform plan
```

3. **Apply the configuration**

```bash
terraform apply
```

* Confirm with `yes`
* Terraform will create the bucket, apply the policy, enable website hosting, and upload all game files

## ðŸ’¡ Notes & Best Practices

* **ACLs vs Bucket Policy:** ACLs control individual objects; bucket policies control the whole bucket.
* **Static website hosting:** All game files must be public to be accessible online.
* **Versioning:** Not required for small portfolio projects; saves storage costs.
* **Production-ready:** For real deployments, consider using **CloudFront** for HTTPS, caching, and global performance.
